# Begginer FE course final project

This was my exam after 80 hours for begginer front-end course. Having a given single page design in Figma I had to replicate it using HTML and CSS for design and give some functionality using JavaScript.

This page is fully responsive, has a navigation bar, forms with alerts and a swipper function for pricing and reviews tabs.
