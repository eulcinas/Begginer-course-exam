# Begginer FE course final project

This was my exam after 80 hours for the beginner front-end course. Having a given single-page design in Figma, I had to replicate it using HTML and CSS for design and add some functionality using JavaScript.

This page is fully responsive and has a navigation bar, forms with alerts, and a swiping function for the pricing and reviews tabs.
